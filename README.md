# UnionFindCaseStudy
A research Study on the time complexity of Union Find Using C++

# Abstract
This research study revolves around analyzing the time complexity of Union Find, also known as disjoint sets used to remove edges that cause a graph to have cycles. Formally, Given the “N” number of nodes with a number of edge “E” ranging from 0 -> N(N – 1)/2, the study answers the question: “What is the time complexity as N increases given different values of E?”. The Union Find used was the Version involving Weighted Union and Collapse Find. The algorithm was implemented using C++ to remove performance drawbacks. The time complexity was approximated by getting the duration of the algorithm across different combinations of “N” and “E,” which was then plotted using the help of Python, Google Collab, and Matplotlib. The researchers then found that the time complexity resembles the function NlogN, where N is the number of nodes, thus concluding that the time complexity must be O(NlogN).
